Test project
The Linux operating system provides for open access to its source code. This has led companies to initially choose Linux as a viable development platform, on the perceived basis that its cost is less than commercial alternatives.
To examine this in earnest we present a three-part whitepaper series that closely examines the total cost of ownership (TCO) of Linux and how that compares to a commercial off-the-shelf realtime operating system like QNX. Specifically, we illustrate life-cycle costs that aren't initially considered, but that have a far bigger contribution to the TCO than the runtime licensing cost.

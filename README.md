The Linux operating system provides for open access to its source code. This has led companies to initially choose Linux as a viable development platform, on the perceived basis that its cost is less than commercial alternatives.
To examine this in earnest we present a three-part whitepaper series that closely examines the total cost of ownership (TCO) of Linux and how that compares to a commercial off-the-shelf realtime operating system like QNX. Specifically, we illustrate life-cycle costs that aren't initially considered, but that have a far bigger contribution to the TCO than the runtime licensing cost.



Direct - the motor torque is proportional to the armture current: the torque can thus be controlled directly and accurately.
Rapid - torque control is fast; the drive system can have a very high dynamic speed response. Torque can be changed instantaneously if the motor is fed from an ideal current source. A voltage fed drive still has a fast response, since this is determined only by the rotorâ€™s electrical time constant (i.e. the total inductance and resistance in the armature circuit) Simple - field orientation is achieved using a simple mechanical device called a commutator/brush assembly.
Hence, there is no need for complex electronic control circuitry, which would increase the cost of the motor controller.


Bearing currents come in several different guises. However,
while modern motor design and manufacturing practices have
nearly eliminated the low frequency bearing currents induced
by the asymmetry of the motor, the rapid switching in modern
AC drive systems may generate high frequency current pulses
through the bearings. If the energy of these pulses is suffi ciently
high, metal transfers from the ball and the races to the lubricant.
This is known as electrical discharge machining or EDM. The
effect of a single pulse is insignifi cant, but a tiny EDM pit is an
incontinuity that will collect more pulses and expand into a typical
EDM crater. The switching frequency of modern AC drives is
very high and the vast number of pulses causes the erosion to
quickly accumulate. As a result, the bearing may need replacing
after only a short time in service.

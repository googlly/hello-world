The Linux operating system provides for open access to its source code. This has led companies to initially choose Linux as a viable development platform, on the perceived basis that its cost is less than commercial alternatives.
To examine this in earnest we present a three-part whitepaper series that closely examines the total cost of ownership (TCO) of Linux and how that compares to a commercial off-the-shelf realtime operating system like QNX. Specifically, we illustrate life-cycle costs that aren't initially considered, but that have a far bigger contribution to the TCO than the runtime licensing cost.



Direct - the motor torque is proportional to the armture current: the torque can thus be controlled directly and accurately.
Rapid - torque control is fast; the drive system can have a very high dynamic speed response. Torque can be changed instantaneously if the motor is fed from an ideal current source. A voltage fed drive still has a fast response, since this is determined only by the rotorâ€™s electrical time constant (i.e. the total inductance and resistance in the armature circuit) Simple - field orientation is achieved using a simple mechanical device called a commutator/brush assembly.
Hence, there is no need for complex electronic control circuitry, which would increase the cost of the motor controller.
